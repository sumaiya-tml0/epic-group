              Epic's Relentless Pursuit of Better
            </h3>
            <div className="text-black space-y-2">
              <p>
                This attitude permeates every dimension of Epic’s operations,
                from product development, innovation and manufacturing
                processes, to the highest levels of social & environmental
                standards, and beyond.
              </p>
              <p>
                This corporate philosophy acknowledges that there is no static
                measure of ‘best’ but rather a constant need to improve beyond
                today’s standards. And then to relentlessly push even further
                ahead to constantly raise the bar over that which has been
                achieved before.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-6">
                We believe that tomorrow’s better will always beat yesterday’s
                best and this lies at the heart of our ongoing mission. It
                applies equally to our internal operations, employee welfare,
                social & community practices, as to our environmental,
                sustainability and ESG standards. In this way Epic has
                demonstrated consistent industry leadership by adopting ever
                higher standards across its triple bottom-line that exceed
                current industry norms and practices.
